            <p class="p1"><strong>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</strong>
                It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory
                syndrome, kidney failure and even death.</p>
            <p class="p3">Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with
                anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>

                                This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections
                                were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person.
                                It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses
                                are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.
                            </p>
                            <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community
                                (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have
                                been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they
                                became infected.

                                The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively
                                sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these
                                patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are)
                                until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
                            </p>
                            <p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from
                                isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention
                                and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each
                                situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory
                                testing for that patient.

                                Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case
                                by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications. <br>
                                The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough. <br>
                                The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected
                                at least 24 hours apart. <br>
                                Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection
                                to others.

                                It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some
                                other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that
                                does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At
                                this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes
                                warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features
                                associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.

                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory
                                droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with
                                food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap
                                and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                                blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has
                                the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is
                                not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
                            </p>

                                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is
                                likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a
                                period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
                            </p>

                                You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                                <b>1. </b> Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. <br>
                                <b>Why? </b> Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                                <b>2. </b> Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. <br>
                                <b>Why?</b> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                                <b>3. </b>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. <br>
                                <b> Why?</b> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                                <b>4. </b> Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. <br>
                                <b>Why? </b>Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                                <b>5.</b> Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. <br>
                                <b>Why? </b>National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
                            </p>

                                <b>6. </b> Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. <br>
                                <b>Why? </b>You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

                            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                                <b>2. </b> Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or her healthcare provider and tell them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that the patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.

                                The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                                The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.

                                Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the person’s sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.

                                This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

                                If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.

                                Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your child’s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend’s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.

                                Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.

                                From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.

                                There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.

Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

                                To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.

                                No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.

                                No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

                                The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.
